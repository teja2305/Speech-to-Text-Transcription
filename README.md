This Python script represents a simple web application using Flask for speech recognition and transcription. The application allows users to transcribe speech input from different sources: microphone, audio file, or video file. It utilizes the MoviePy, SpeechRecognition, and PyDub libraries for video/audio processing and speech recognition.

Here's a breakdown of the key components and functionalities:

1.Audio and Video Processing:
The extract_audio_from_video function extracts audio from a video file using the MoviePy library.
The convert_mp3_to_wav function uses PyDub to convert an MP3 audio file to WAV format.

2.Speech Recognition:
The application uses the SpeechRecognition library to perform Google Web Speech API-based speech recognition on audio input.
The script defines an Easter egg trigger and a corresponding random phrase, providing a fun interaction if the recognized speech contains the trigger.

3.Flask Web Application:
The Flask web application has three routes: / (main page), /save_transcript (to save the transcript to a file), and a default route that starts the Flask app.
The main page (/) allows users to choose the input type (microphone, audio file, or video file) and transcribes the speech accordingly.
The transcript can be saved to a text file using the /save_transcript route.

4.User Interaction:
Users can choose the input type through a web interface.
For microphone input, the application captures speech using the microphone and transcribes it.
For audio and video file inputs, the user can upload the respective files, and the application transcribes the speech after converting the audio to WAV format.

5.Dependencies:
The script relies on external libraries, including Flask, MoviePy, SpeechRecognition, and PyDub. Ensure these are installed before running the script.
